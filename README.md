<h2>Eye Abnormality Prediction Using OCT Scans</h2>

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project integrated with a web application built using the Django framework, HTML, and CSS. The project aims to predict abnormalities in the retina, such as DMA (Diabetic Macular Edema), Drusen, CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization), or classify the retina as normal using basic OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans.

<b>Features</b>

Machine Learning Model:

-Trained on OCT scan datasets to classify retinal abnormalities.

-Utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for high accuracy.

-Pretrained models like ResNet or custom CNN architectures are implemented.

Web Application:

Built using the Django framework for seamless integration of ML models.

Frontend designed with HTML and CSS for an intuitive user interface.

Allows users to upload OCT scan images and view predictions.

Prediction Categories:

DMA: Diabetic Macular Edema.

Drusen: Small yellowish deposits under the retina.

CNV: Choroidal Neovascularization.

Normal: Healthy retina.
